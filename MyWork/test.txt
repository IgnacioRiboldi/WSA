Ignacio woke up early that morning. Ignacio looked out the window and saw the sun gently lighting up the garden. With a smile, Ignacio decided that today would be a special day.

Ignacio called his friend and said, “Ignacio, do you want to come for a walk in the forest with me?” His friend, surprised by Ignacio insisting on using his name in every sentence, laughed and agreed.

As they walked, Ignacio told stories from his childhood. Ignacio remembered learning to ride a bike without training wheels and how Ignacio had once fallen into a huge puddle, getting completely soaked. Each memory made Ignacio and his friend laugh endlessly.

At the end of the day, Ignacio said goodbye with a hug and thought that, even though saying his own name so many times seemed strange, Ignacio felt happier than ever.
