Andrew woke up early that morning. Andrew looked out the window and saw the sun gently lighting up the garden. With a smile, Andrew decided that today would be a special day.

Andrew called his friend and said, “Andrew, do you want to come for a walk in the forest with me?” His friend, surprised by Andrew insisting on using his name in every sentence, laughed and agreed.

As they walked, Andrew told stories from his childhood. Andrew remembered learning to ride a bike without training wheels and how Andrew had once fallen into a huge puddle, getting completely soaked. Each memory made Andrew and his friend laugh endlessly.

At the end of the day, Andrew said goodbye with a hug and thought that, even though saying his own name so many times seemed strange, Andrew felt happier than ever.
